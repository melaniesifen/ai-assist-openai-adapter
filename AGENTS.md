## Repo Purpose

`ai-assist-openai-adapter` owns OpenAI-specific credential validation, generation request mapping, streaming normalization, usage normalization, capabilities, and provider error mapping.

## Agent Instructions

- Read `README.md`, `ai-assist-platform-context.md`, and the provider sections in `../ai-assist-architecture/ai-workflow-assistant-platform-architecture-spec.md` before changing behavior.
- Use injected client boundaries. Do not call real OpenAI APIs in unit tests.
- Do not store provider keys. Decrypted keys should only pass through authorized provider-call paths.
- Do not log prompts, document context, model responses, provider keys, authorization headers, or raw provider errors that may contain sensitive content.
- Normalize provider errors to stable categories such as invalid credential, quota, rate limited, unavailable, context too large, policy blocked, and unknown provider error.
- Add tests for credential validation, malformed requests, stream normalization, usage metadata, error mapping, and safe logging.

## Commands

- Run tests with `node --test`.
- `npm` may not be available in this environment; prefer the direct Node command.

## Review Notes

Before committing, review for prompt/key leakage, provider-specific details leaking into shared contracts, and ambiguous provider responses failing open.
